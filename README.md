## 👋 Hi, I’m Maham! 
- I’m a recent Applied Math Master's graduate, passionate about using mathematics to understand the world and meaningfully solve problems.
    Current areas of interest include, but are not limited to, applied machine learning, numerical mathematics, computational science, ODE's/PDE's/DDE's, computational biology, mathematical modeling, and many more.
- I’m currently learning high performance scientific computing, and excited to utilize the skills I'm learning to better approach industrial and academic research areas!
- I can be reached through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maham-khalid1/) profile!
